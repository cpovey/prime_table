	# Our basic test consists of looking for a number x less than num (starting with 3) that divides evenly into num. If we find such an x, we return false.

	# 	 - If num is even, it cannot be prime (since all even numbers are divisible by 2)
	#    - We can stop looking after we get to sqrt(num) since this represents the largest possible x that will not simply be a repeat of
	#      an earlier combination of factors

	# Another algorithm, based on the rule that every non-prime is simply the product of one or more primes. Therefore, testing non-primes 
	# as factors is redundant, since this is equivalant to trying the component primes multiple times (duplicate work). So instead, we only test
	# whether a num is divisible by the primes we've found so far (which will be every prime less than num)
