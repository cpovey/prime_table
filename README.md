# prime_table
Simple tool to calculate the first n prime numbers, and print them out in multiplication table form. 

Usage:
	prime_mult_table.rb <N>
Where	<N> : Number of primes to include in multiplication table


## Running spec
prime_table uses RSpec for its tests, so you'll need to install the rspec gem (gem install rspec) Then, simply run rspec in the main project directory (or alternatively, run the spec file explicitly via "rspec prime_table_spec.rb")

## Running benchmark script
I also wrote a benchmark tool for fun, since I implemented two slightly different algorithms for determining primality and wanted to see how the performance compared between the two. 

### Alg. 1:
Our basic test consists of looking for a number x less than num (starting with 3) that divides evenly into num. If we find such an x, we return false. Otherwise, if we reach num without returning, we know num is prime. We also take a couple shortcuts to speed up the algorithm:
	Shortcuts:
		- If num is even, it cannot be prime (since all even numbers are divisible by 2)
	  - We can stop looking after we get to sqrt(num) since this represents the largest possible x that will not simply be a repeat of
			an earlier combination of factors
		- We only need to consider odd numbers for x, since odd numbers can't have an even factor (and at this point, we already know num has to be odd)

### Alg. 2:
Based on the mathematical rule that every non-prime number is simply the product of one or more primes. Therefore, testing non-primes as factors is redundant, since this would be equivalant to trying the component primes multiple times (which is duplicate work). So instead, we only test whether a num is divisible by the primes we've found so far (which will be every prime less than num).

Note on benchmarks: Surprisingly, Alg. 2 is actually slower when calculating smaller numbers of primes (e.g. ~5000 or fewer). This is surprising, since Alg. 2 should reduce the number of iterations per test by a fair amount. However, when calculating very large sets of primes (e.g. on the order of 100,000), Alg. 2 is noticeably faster, as we would expect. My best guess is that this has to do with overhead associated with the array iteration (i.e. "#each" in Alg. 2 as compared to the basic while loop condition in Alg. 1) as well as the need to pass the array as a parameter in Alg. 2.
